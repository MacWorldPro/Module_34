        "### Understanding TF-IDF Features\n",
        "\n",
        "TF-IDF stands for **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency**. It is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. This helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general (like \"the\", \"is\", \"in\") and should not be considered as important as context-specific words.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Components of TF-IDF\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Term Frequency (TF)**:\n",
        "   - The term frequency is simply the count of a term in a document. However, to prevent bias towards longer documents, it is usually normalized by the document length (i.e., the total number of terms in the document).\n",
        "\n",
        "   \\[\n",
        "   \\text{TF}(t, d) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times term } t \\text{ appears in document } d}{\\text{Total number of terms in document } d}\n",
        "   \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**:\n",
        "   - The inverse document frequency is a measure of how much information the word provides, i.e., if it’s common or rare across all documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "   \\[\n",
        "   \\text{IDF}(t, D) = \\log \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total number of documents}}{\\text{Number of documents containing term } t} \\right)\n",
        "   \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "   Words that appear in many documents have a low IDF, while words that appear in fewer documents have a high IDF.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **TF-IDF Score**:\n",
        "   - The TF-IDF score is calculated as the product of TF and IDF.\n",
        "\n",
        "   \\[\n",
        "   \\text{TF-IDF}(t, d, D) = \\text{TF}(t, d) \\times \\text{IDF}(t, D)\n",
        "   \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "### How TF-IDF Works\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Normalization**: Each term's frequency is normalized to prevent bias towards longer documents.\n",
        "- **Weighting**: Terms that are common across many documents have their importance reduced, while terms that are rare across the corpus are given higher importance.\n",
        "- **Sparse Representation**: Typically, TF-IDF matrices are sparse because most terms do not appear in most documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of TF-IDF\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Relevance**: TF-IDF helps to filter out common words and highlight the important words in the context of the document.\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: It is computationally efficient and simple to implement.\n",
        "- **Effectiveness**: It often provides better results compared to raw term frequencies, especially in scenarios like information retrieval and text classification.\n",
